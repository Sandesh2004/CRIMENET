<h3>Police Station Resource Management System</h3>
<br>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project is a collaborative effort aimed at solving the problem of inefficient management of police station resources and enhancing the accessibility of critical information. The system automates various tasks, such as managing police station resources, organizing and searching criminal data, and providing accessible information for efficient deployment of law enforcement resources.
<br>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The problem revolves around the inefficient management of police station resources and the lack of seamless accessibility to critical information. This can lead to delays in emergency responses, unclear resource deployment, and difficulties for the public in accessing necessary information. The project aims to automate the process of managing police station resources, streamline information about police employees and their respective designations, and provide accessible data for efficient resource deployment.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Creation of CSV Files for Police and Criminal Databases:
    </li>
    Separate CSV files are created for each police station, organizing data for both police personnel and criminals. This streamlines data management and facilitates seamless access to critical information.
    <li>Data Insertion into Police Station Databases:
    </li>
    Criminal and police data are inserted into their respective CSV files, ensuring accuracy and relevance. This step enhances the effectiveness of law enforcement by keeping the data up-to-date and accessible.
    <li>Graph Creation Using Linked List:
    </li>
    A graph representing Belgaum city's spatial relationships is created using a linked list data structure. Weights are assigned to the edges, representing distances or other metrics, which can be used for route optimization and resource allocation.
    <li>Criminal Search Using KMP String Pattern Matching Algorithm:
    </li>
    The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string pattern matching algorithm is implemented to search for specific criminal records across all police station databases. This allows for efficient and accurate identification of relevant criminal data.
    <li>Menu System with Police Authentication:
    </li>
    A menu system is developed with secure police authentication, including a hidden password feature. This system allows users to explore city information, find the nearest police station, search for criminals, and perform other relevant tasks while ensuring secure access to sensitive operations.
